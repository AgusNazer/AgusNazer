Hi there! I'm a software developer with a passion for building solutions that make a real difference in our technological world. I have experience working on blockchain-based projects. I'm currently studying at the National Technological University, which has helped me develop critical thinking skills and a solid understanding not only of technical concepts but also of business logic.

I'm a software developer with a stronger focus on backend development, and I have experience working with Java, Node.js, and .NET


## Collaboration and Projects 🤝
I am always open to collaborating on exciting and challenging projects. I firmly believe that the best way to learn is by tackling new challenges and continuously improving as a professional.

If you wish to contact me to collaborate on projects, share ideas, or simply chat about web development and technology, please do not hesitate to send me a message
