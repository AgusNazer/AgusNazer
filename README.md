Hi there! I'm a software developer with a passion for building solutions that make a real difference in our technologically world. Right now, I'm part of a team working on a project about energy tokenization, with the power of blockchain technology. 
I like researching and learning about new topics, and that is why I have recently delved into the world of web3.


## Collaboration and Projects 🤝
I am always open to collaborating on exciting and challenging projects. I firmly believe that the best way to learn is by tackling new challenges and continuously improving as a professional.

If you wish to contact me to collaborate on projects, share ideas, or simply chat about web development and technology, please do not hesitate to send me a message
